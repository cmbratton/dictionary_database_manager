# dictionary_database_manager

Colby Bratton

Smaller project that demonstrates basic utilization of languages and resources,
such as HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, AJAX server communication, and JSON
encoding/decoding. This project focused on the manipulation, by the user, of a
database of words that can be utilized as a dictionary. The user is allowed to
add and delete words from the database (no duplicate entries). To see a running
version of this application, go to:
